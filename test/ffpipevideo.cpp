 * It's basically the same program placed under fastflow/examples/OpenCVvideo/ffvideo.cpp
 * but instead of testing a "pure pipeline": pipe(Source, Stage1, Stage2, Drain) it will
 * be tested a pipeline with an inner pipeline: pipe(Source, pipe(Stage1, Stage2), Drain).
 * (-v option: visualize output video)
